        <h3>What is Thetruspace?</h3>
        <p>Thetruspace is a platform for truth and the political center. People are <i>tribal</i>. It is easy for people on one side of the cultural divide to strawman arguments from the other side in order to win. It fuels hate and spreads misinformation, and we do not need any more of that. Thetruspace aims to become a trusted source of information by presenting steelman (strong) arguments from both sides.</p> 
        <p>We look at the facts and examine them from a non-biased perspective. We assume good faith from the left and the right that most people support freedom of speech. We check our implicit bias to make sure we do not misrepresent anyone.</p>
        <h3>Who are we?</h3>
        <p>At the moment, there is only one person behind thetruspace. He is a front end web developer and writes articles on cultural divide between the political left and the right. I know, it's not a common combination of hobbies!</p>
        <h3>How can you contact us?</h3>
        <p>If you have business inquries, or find thetruspace mischaracterized you, your side or even the other side, please reach out to thetruspace@gmail.com.
